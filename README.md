# Embedded-Thermostat

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
  - This project was to develop code to communicate with an embedded device. It runs with an ongoing timer and checks for any buttons pressed and the current temperature that's pulled from the temperature sensor. This problem solved the need to have a smart thermostat that can eventually be brought onto the cloud.
 
# What did you do particularly well?
  - I did well with implementing the DRY principle and making the code simple and device easy to read.
  
# Where could you improve?
  - Upon completing this project, I can confidently say that I need to improve on my knowledge of C and further comfortability with microprocessors.
  
# What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  - Some resources that I'll be adding are the docs that came with my microprocessor. In there there's a lot of transferrable information that I believe I could use with other devices.


# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  - I have learned a lot about developing with embedded devices and there's a huge market for it. I want to take the knowledge of how to do so with future projects that involve them.


# How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  - By enforicing the DRY principle, I already made my code that much more maintainable and readable. I also included comments where needed and made sure to use variable names that will be easy for any other developers to understand.
